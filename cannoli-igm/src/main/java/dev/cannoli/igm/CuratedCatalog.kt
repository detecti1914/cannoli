// The curated in-game settings: task-shaped rows rather than key-shaped ones, so "Screen Scaling"
// is one choice instead of three RetroArch settings the player has to combine correctly.
//
// Values here are RetroArch's MACHINE values, matched against RaSetting.machineValue, never against
// RaSetting.value. A combobox like aspect_ratio_index reports "Core Provided" in value, which is
// translated and therefore not something to compare.
//
// Aspect indices come from enum aspect_ratio in retroarch/gfx/video_defines.h:
// ASPECT_RATIO_CORE = 22, ASPECT_RATIO_CUSTOM = 23, ASPECT_RATIO_FULL = 24.

 * RetroArch keys that more than one part of Cannoli names.
 *
 * The viewport takeover shadows these two while it holds the screen, and the curated catalogue
 * matches against the shadowed pair to resolve a scaling preset. A spelling that drifts between the
 * two ends resolves no preset, and the row then adopts the first one over the user's choice.
