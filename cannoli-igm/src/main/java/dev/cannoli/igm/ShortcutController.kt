/**
 * Turns chord presses into the things they were bound to.
 *
 * Native decides when a chord counts; this decides what it means. Every action here already exists
 * somewhere else in the menu or the bridge, so this is a dispatch table rather than an
 * implementation: a shortcut and a menu row that do the same thing should do it the same way.
 *
 * Matching is not here because it cannot be. A chord has to be recognised in the key event that
 * completes it, so the keys it claims can be taken back out of the input state before the core's
 * next poll; anything reaching this process is already several frames late, by which time the game
 * has acted on the press. [ShortcutTable.encode] is what native is given.
