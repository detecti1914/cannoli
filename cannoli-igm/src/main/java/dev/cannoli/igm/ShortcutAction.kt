/**
 * The in-game actions a chord can be bound to.
 *
 * [holdMs] is how long the chord must stay down before the action runs, 0 for the usual case of
 * running the moment the chord completes. Only an action you would regret firing by accident earns
 * one. The chord's keys are taken from the game as soon as it matches either way, so the wait costs
 * the game nothing; what it buys is a chance to let go.
 *
 * CYCLE_SCALING was retired on 2026-08-31: v2 answers it better through Screen Geometry and the
 * aspect rows in All Settings, where the value is visible while it changes, and a blind cycle
 * through RetroArch's aspect table mostly lands somewhere nobody wants. A stale entry in
 * shortcuts.ini for it is skipped rather than failing the file.
