# Regenerate patches/ from the current state of the retroarch/ submodule.
#
# Run this after resolving a bump in the RA tree. One patch per upstream file, so a patch can always
# be regenerated with a single git diff and a conflict is scoped to one file. The roster used to be
# split by concern, which meant retroarch.c and cheevos/cheevos.c were each edited by two patches:
# `git diff -- retroarch.c` then produced the union of both and neither could be regenerated without
# splitting it by hand, every bump, on the files upstream churns most.
#
# Not covered here, deliberately:
#   - Android.mk is edited in place by apply-patches.sh, not patched.
#   - RetroActivityFuture.java is deleted by apply-patches.sh, not patched.
#   - ricotta_bridge.c and ricotta_osd.h are copied from ricotta/jni by apply-patches.sh.
# Diffs against HEAD rather than the index: git apply -3 stages what it merges, so an
# index-versus-worktree diff comes back empty after a conflicted bump.

# retroactivity_common was retired at the 9770234364 bump: it guarded registerReceiver behind an
# SDK check because upstream did not, which crashed on Android 14. Upstream now does it itself.
