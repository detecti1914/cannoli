/**
 * Answers the achievement client from Cannoli's cache when the server cannot be reached or does not
 * recognise the ROM, and records what the server says the rest of the time.
 *
 * Only ever built for a softcore session. The bridge withholds it in hardcore, because everything
 * here can put words in the server's mouth and a hardcore run has to reach the real server or fail.
 *
 * Every request is answered only after its own attempt has failed, an unlock included: a cached set
 * served while the network works would freeze a game's achievements at whatever was cached, and a
 * spoofed unlock would keep the score the server sent out of the body the client reads. An unlock is
 * still never lost, because the failure path records the failure before it asks the cache, so the
 * one request that has failed is taken over on the spot and queued for the launcher to replay.
