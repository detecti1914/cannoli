/**
 * The per-game config names the save directory outright instead of letting RetroArch derive it.
 * Deriving it means by-content sorting, which appends the ROM's *parent* directory: correct for a
 * loose ROM, wrong for a bundled multi-disc game whose parent is the bundle folder.
 *
 * The directory is the game's own folder under its platform, keyed the way guides, cheats and
 * states already are, so one game's saves are one directory whatever shape the emulator writes.
