     * statement about the exact bytes on offer and also reports their size.

     * The second step is not belt and braces. The index can disagree with the archive it indexes:
     * a core whose published CRC does not match the `.so` inside its own zip is reported stale on
     * every check, because downloading it records the real checksum and that still will not match.
     * The etag settles it, and costs one bodyless request per candidate.
     *
     * When the index is unreachable every core becomes a candidate, which is the behaviour before
     * any of this existed: correct, just slower to answer.

     * CRC cannot vouch for still goes through the conditional request, which answers 304 and
     * transfers nothing when there is genuinely nothing new.
     *
     * Cancelling stops before the next core. Nothing is rolled back, which is safe because each
     * core is staged and renamed, so a cancelled run leaves some cores newer and none broken.
