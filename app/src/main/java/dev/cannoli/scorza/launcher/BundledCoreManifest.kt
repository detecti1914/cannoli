/**
 * What each core in the APK was when it was bundled, written by `scripts/record_bundled_core.py`
 * during `task cores`.
 *
 * The buildbot has no history to pin to, so a bundled core has no version to ask for and no
 * validator of its own: it came out of the APK, not off the network. Recording both at the moment
 * the build machine fetched it is the only place either is knowable.
 *
 * It answers two questions the app cannot otherwise answer honestly:
 *
 * - **Has this changed?** Without an etag the first update would download all fifteen bundled cores
 *   in full, roughly 48 MB, to discover that most had not changed.
 * - **Which build is this?** Not `display_version`: that is hand-maintained upstream and moves on a
 *   different clock, so gambatte has declared v0.5.0 since 2022 while its binary is rebuilt nightly.
 *   The date the buildbot wrote the file is what actually distinguishes two installs.
