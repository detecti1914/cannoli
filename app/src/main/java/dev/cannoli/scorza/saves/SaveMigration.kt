/**
 * Moves a game's loose save files into its own folder.
 *
 * Saves were the one per-content artifact Cannoli did not key by [dev.cannoli.core.RomKey], which
 * left three call sites independently stem-matching over the platform directory and all three
 * blind to a directory save. One folder per game removes the matching entirely.
 *
 * Attribution comes from the caller, which knows the rom rows. Nothing here parses a filename to
 * decide who owns a save: a file that belongs to no game is left exactly where it is, because
 * moving something we cannot attribute is how a migration destroys data it did not understand.
